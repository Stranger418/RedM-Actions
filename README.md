Notes
Control Keys: The IsControlJustPressed function uses control indexes to check key presses. The index 182 corresponds to the 'L' key, and 73 corresponds to the 'X' key in the default configuration. Adjust these indexes if needed based on your control settings.

Scenarios: The scenario names used (WORLD_HUMAN_POINTING and WORLD_HUMAN_COP_IDLES) might not exactly match what you want. You may need to replace them with the correct scenario names based on RedM's available animations.

Task Management: Ensure that the animations or tasks used for pointing and raising hands do not conflict with other actions.

This script will allow players to control their character's pointing and hands-up actions using the specified keys. Adjust and test as needed to fit your serverâ€™s requirements.
